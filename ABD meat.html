  <h1><u><b>COUNTRIES THAT EAT THE MOST MEAT</b></u></h1>

<p>30th October 2023 by: <u><i>Abdullah Zhaparov</i></u> </p>

 <h3><u><b>Introduction: </b></u></h3>

 <p>The countries that eat the most meat are causing 
 <i>significant damage</i> to the <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoFWXMY9gvOlhlRwyFrOeSqZkK8Lq-9dtOsA&usqp=CAU"> planet </a>.
  It is time to take responsibility and change the habits of a lifetime</p>

 <p>Now, I am neither <i>vegetarian nor vegan</i>, 
   Despite some signs the <a href="https://assets.ourworldindata.org/uploads/2021/12/Population-cartogram_World-1536x587.png">global population growth</a> rate.
   is slowing, the <b>world's total population continues to 
   skyrocket</b>. As things stand, the planet simply cannot 
   support the current levels of <em>meat consumption</em>.

 <p>It is not down to the size of a country's population, 
   but how rich that population is. The <u>more money we have,
   the more meat we eat</u>. For those in low-income countries, 
   meat is still very much a luxury. </p>

 <p>Meat is always on the menu in many parts of the world, 
    as we can see when we map out <u>meat consumption by 
    country</u>.</p>

    pork, mutton, poultry, seafood, or other </i> with annual 
    consumption calculated per capita in kilograms (kg).</p>
